## Getting Started

**This is repository starts of with the difficulty level of easy on leetcode's problem section.**
**The plan is to start out easy and increase the difficulty over time**
**It is meant for reference , documentation and a learning material so feel free to fork or download and have a glimpse of how
I solved the challenges.**
**There is a spec folder which contains tests to the solved problem. All tests are done using RSPEC.**
#
_To set up RSPEC SPEC FOLDER DO :_
 1. type rspec --init in your terminal,ensure you are in your project folder
 1. navigate to the created spec in the file directory and create a test file e.g name_of_file_spec.rb
 1. open the test file and at the top of write: require './name_of_file'
 1. to run tests on terminal type either the rspec command(runs all test) or rspec ./spec/name_of_file_spec.rb (to run a particular test)**
