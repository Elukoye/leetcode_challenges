## Getting Started

**This is repository starts of with the difficulty level of easy on leetcode's problem section.**
**The plan is to start out easy and increase the difficulty over time**

I solved the challenges.**
**There is a spec folder which contains tests to the solved problem. All tests are done using RSPEC.**
**To set up RSPEC SPEC FOLDER DO :
 1.rspec --init in your project folder
 1.navigate to spec and create a test file e.g name_of_file_spec.rb
 1.at the top of name_of_file_spec.rb require './name_of_file'
 1. run tests on terminal using either rspec command or rspec ./spec/name_of_file_spec.rb (to run one test)**
